- 1. Two Sum
    ```
    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    Example:

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    ```

- 567. Permutation in String
    ```
    Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.
    Example 1:

    Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
    Output: True
    Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
    Example 2:

    Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
    Output: False

    Note:

    The input strings only contain lower case letters.
    The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].
    ```
